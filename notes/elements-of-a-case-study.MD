# What are the core elements of a case study?

## Introduce the client

- Who was the client?
- What industry are they in?
- What goods or services do they provide?
- Keep this section brief.

## Present the design problem

- What was the client’s problem?
- Why was it important that the problem be solved?
- Are there any additional background tidbits that might be helpful or interesting?

## Recap your role

- What, specifically, were you hired to do?
- What were the constraints? Time. Budgetary. Technological. Etc.

## Share the solution you designed

- Before diving into your process, summarize the solution you designed.
- Make the summary short but powerful.
- Don’t give all the good parts away, and don’t be afraid to use language that makes your audience curious about the rest of the project.

## Walk through the steps of your design process

- Go through the various steps of your discipline specific process.
- Again, summarize what you did, but don’t overload. Find a balance between informational and interesting.
- If you can, try to make each step introduce a question that only the following step can answer.

## Describe the results.

- Use this section to share a more robust description of the results of your design process.
- Be direct, avoid jargon, and don’t get too carried away with the amount of text you include.

## Note any key learnings

- Don’t go overboard here, but if there are interesting things that you learned during the process, include them.
- If they won’t be helpful for the client, leave them out.

## Wrap it all up with a short conclusion

- Quickly summarize the project, and invite potential customers to contact you.
- It doesn’t hurt to provide a call to action and a contact link.

## Share client feedback

- How did the client feel about your working relationship and the solution you provided? When you deliver top-notch work and nurture trust, get client feedback and include it in the case study as a testimonial.
- If something you designed blew your client away, weave a testimonial into the case study (along with an image of what you made). This combo is proof positive to potential customers that you can deliver

## Explain positive metrics

- Not all design work has direct metrics that prove its success, but if your work does, and the results are impressive, include them. Just make sure that you don’t mislead (easy to do with statistics), and be careful that the metrics make sense to your audience.

## Highlight unglamorous design features

- Not every aspect of design is glamorous. Like a pinky finger, small details may seem insignificant but they’re actually indispensable. Highlight these and recap why they matter.

## Link to live projects

- It can be highly persuasive for a client to experience your work doing it’s thing out in the real world. Don’t hesitate to include links to live projects. Just make sure that your role in the project is clear, especially when you didn’t design everything you’re linking to.
