# How to write a formal email

Follow these five simple steps to make sure your English emails are perfectly
professional.

- Begin with a greeting
- Thank the recipient
- State your purpose
- Add your closing remarks
- End with a closing

## Begin with a greeting

Always open your email with a greeting, such as “**_Dear Rebecca_**” . If your relationship with the reader is formal, use their family name (eg. “**_Dear Mrs. Price_**” ). If the relationship is more casual, you can simply say, “**_Hi Jordan_**” . If you don’t know the name of the person you are writing to, use: “**_To whom it may concern_**” or “**_Dear Sir/Madam_**”.

## Thank the recipient

If you are replying to a client’s inquiry, you should begin with a line of thanks. For example, if someone has a question about your company, you can say, “**_Thank you for contacting ABC Company_**”. If you want to follow up with a client or employer, you can say, “**_Thank you for taking the time to meet with me_**”. If someone has replied to one of your emails, be sure to say, “**_Thank you for your prompt reply_**” or “**_Thanks for getting back to me_**”. Thanking the reader puts him or her at ease, and it will make you appear more polite.

## State your purpose

If you are starting the email communication, it may be impossible to include a line of thanks. Instead, begin by stating your purpose. For example, “**_I am writing to enquire about … (or inform you)_**” or “**_I am writing in reference to our meeting…_**” .

Make your purpose clear early on in the email (and subject), and then move into the main text of your email. Remember, people want to read emails quickly, so keep your sentences short and clear. You’ll also need to pay careful attention to grammar, spelling and punctuation so that you present a professional image of yourself and your company.

## Add your closing remarks

Before you end your email, it’s polite to thank your reader one more time and add some polite closing remarks. You might start with “**_Thank you for your patience and cooperation_**” or “**_Thank you for your consideration_**” and then follow up with, “**_If you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to let me know_**” or “**_Please, do not hesitate to contact if you have any further questions_**” and/or “**_I look forward to hearing from you_**” .

## End with a closing

The last step is to include an appropriate closing with your name. “**_Best regards_**” , “**_Sincerely_**” , and “**_Thank you_**” are all professional. Avoid closings such as “Best wishes” or “**_Cheers_**” unless you are good friends with the reader. Finally, before you hit the send button, **_review and spell check your email one more time to make sure it’s truly perfect!_**
