# MANAGE A WEB PROJECT

- Prepare a portfolio _(web, pdf, ppt, etc.)_
- Write a formal email and/or prepare a short presentation
- Research potential clients _(friends, family, coworkers, local business, online, etc.)_
- Send questionnaire by email, create a board on Pinterest and invite the client to pin a few inspirations that he/she likes (or vice versa)
- Set meeting to go over the questionnaire, his/her overall needs and the Pinterest board
- Take a **_lot of notes_**!
- Look online and research what competition is doing
- Build wireframe(s)
- Present wireframe(s) and discuss the sections with the client. Revise, if necessary
- Create prototype (using Adobe Photoshop or XD) according to the wireframe and the client’s inspirations
- Present the prototype to the client and revise, if necessary
- Export graphic elements from prototype and integrate them into a website
- Present the final website to the client

_Prioritize Zoom/Google meetings for all your communications rather than phone calls. It’s
easier to understand the client when there’s a visual interaction. Google Meet is free!_
