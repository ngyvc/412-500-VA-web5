<!-- ### Week 1 - Gather and prepare materials for showcase

For the first assignment, look through your projects and find **three** projects that you are proud to promote. Prepare materials from those projects including any preparation materials like sketches, wireframes, drafts, etc (anything related to the project that can add value). Write a brief description to the projects for presentation in class.

### Week 1 - Find a client

Start looking for a client for the client project. -->

<!-- 

### Week 2- Introduction page & Social Media Posts

For next week, you will create a simple (single) landing page as an introduction about yourself (for Natalia's class) and three (3) social media posts on 3 different projects you worked on.

Do not overcomplicate things for your landing page. Keep it simple and responsive (mobile first). For the social media posts, you should gather some material and / or screenshots (You will need them for your personal portfolio later in the semester). Keep your resources as high resolution as possible, we will revisit resizing for web again later.

**Remember, most important thing is to be creative about your presentation!**

### Week 3 - Portfolio template structure and ideas

For next week, bring ideas for your portfolio template: how do you want one of your portfolio template pages to look? Bring material and ideas for structuring a template in class. -->

<!-- ### Week 1 - Anatomy of a website

### Week 3 - Clients
